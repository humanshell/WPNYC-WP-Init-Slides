# Slides from my presentation on the WordPress Initialization process

This repo contains the slides used during my talk at the WPNYC meetup on
11/15/2011.

They were created using the excellent [CSS-based slideshow system](https://github.com/LeaVerou/CSSS) created by [Lea Verou](http://lea.verou.me/).
